Total number of known unique builds: 10

NOTE: Some of these don't have a pointer-based signature because none exists: they don't have a signature yet for this reason.

These games have no initialization build and instead immediately load the actual sound driver (probably because it intends on using the initialization code stored in the sound driver itself rather than using it separately):
