NOTE: For the following cases, please see Konami Build Sorting Notes Expert Edition. The previous cases somewhat required an opcode-based comparison methodology because of game-specific sound data being stored beforehand, but the pointer differences become more massive beyond this point. The starting location is actually consistent, namely $0200: however under almost all conditions it gets overwritten after execution.

(Program starts at $0200 (with most code starting at ???? - Sorting method TODO)
(NOTE: All of these would normally start at $0200. For Pop 'n Twinbee, it only contains a JMP opcode, and for all others, they contain initialization code in general. However, they get overwritten AND there is game-specific sound data beyond this point resulting in massive differences prior to the code, where the code may or may not be subject to additional differences.)
